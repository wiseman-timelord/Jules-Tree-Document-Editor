# GTK Installer

Please download the GTK 3.8.1 runtime installer for Windows (32-bit) and place it in this directory.

- **File:** `gtk-runtime-3.8.1-i686.exe`
- **Download:** [https://sourceforge.net/projects/gtk3win/files/gtk-runtime-3.8.1-i686.exe/download](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gtk3win/files/gtk-runtime-3.8.1-i686.exe/download)

The `installer.bat` script will look for this file and use it to set up the GTK environment for the application.
